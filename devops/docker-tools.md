The new Docker tools from Docker Inc.

Docker Machine provides developers and system administrators the ability to both provision and host infrastructure, then install the engine. Docker Machine supports Amazon Web Services EC2, Google Cloud Platform, IBM SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure, and a few others.

Docker Swarm provides clustering, scheduling, and integration capabilities. This tool enables developers to build and ship multicontainer/multihost distributed applications for the necessary scaling and management for container-based systems.

Docker Compose simplifies the work for Docker developers, allowing them to create multicontainer implementations using declarative YAML files, which can then define the containers comprising an application, providing orchestration capabilities so they can be bound together to form distributed applications.
